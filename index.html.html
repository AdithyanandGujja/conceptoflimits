  <h2>What Is a Limit?</h2>
  <div class="fun-box">
    <p>Imagine you are <b>walking toward a wall</b>, but you can never actually touch it. You take a big step, then a smaller step, then a tiny, tiny step. Each time, you get <b>closer and closer</b> to the wall, but you never really reach it.</p>
    <p>A <b>limit</b> is just the special spot you get super close to, even if you never actually get there!</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Let’s Try With Ice Cream!</h2>
  <div class="fun-box">
    <span class="ice-cream">🍦</span>
    <p>Think about eating a big ice cream cone. Instead of big bites, you take <b>tiny licks</b>. Every lick gets you closer to the tip, but you never finish it completely. The <b>limit</b> is like asking, “What’s left at the very end, even if you never actually get there?”</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Why Do We Use Limits?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To see what happens when we get really, really close to a number.</li>
    <li>To help with things we can’t do in normal math, like dividing by zero.</li>
    <li>To guess the “last number” in a pattern, even if we can’t say it out loud.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Fun Example: The Magic Number</h2>
  <div class="fun-box">
    <p>Let’s say you want to know what happens to the number <b>sin(x)/x</b> as x gets closer and closer to zero.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try x = 0.1: sin(0.1)/0.1 is close to 1.</li>
      <li>Try x = 0.01: sin(0.01)/0.01 is even closer to 1.</li>
      <li>Try x = 0.001: sin(0.001)/0.001 is super close to 1!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even though you can’t divide by zero, the <b>limit</b> is 1, because that’s the number you get super close to.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Limits in Real Life</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting closer and closer to the tip of your ice cream cone</li>
    <li>Walking toward a wall but never touching it</li>
    <li>Spinning on a merry-go-round and getting closer to a special spot</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try It Yourself!</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a number you want to get close to (like 0).</li>
    <li>Pick a math rule (like sin(x)/x).</li>
    <li>Try numbers really, really close (like 0.1, 0.01, 0.001).</li>
    <li>See what number you’re almost reaching!</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Remember</h2>
  <div class="fun-box">
    <p>A <b>limit</b> is just the number you get closer and closer to, even if you never actually land on it. It helps us see where things are going, even if we never get there!</p>
  </div>
